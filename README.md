# Classification_Tree

Here I practiced a classification problem using an <em> XGBoost Classifier </em> to improve a normal classification tree case. This is an <em> Ensemble Learning </em> method called <em> Boosting </em>. The model is trained with a dataset obtained from the UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. It contains clinical attributes of cells obtained by FNA (fine needle aspirate) from patients' breast mass. Find more info about this dataset <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic"> here </a>.
